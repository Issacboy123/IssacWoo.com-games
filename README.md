# IssacWoo.com-games (games.issacwoo.com)
All of my games are hosted on GitHub and accessible online using GitHub Pages. None of these files contain the actual source code, just the compiled and exported versions so that they can be embedded onto my website. This repository is used just to host the files, not for working with the source code.
